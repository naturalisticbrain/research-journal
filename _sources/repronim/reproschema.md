### 10/16/2023 - 10/20/2023
- had a meeting with Dorota & Sooyang discussing about where we are at with LinkML
- Dorota & Sooyang will keep working on this next Monday, YC will catch up on this after OHBM submission

### 09/25/2023 - 09/29/2023
- got some feedback on other comparable tools (added to the outline) at the repronim meeting
- fix abcd_cbcl01 scoring, see [PR](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/pull/68)

### 09/18/2023 - 09/22/2023
- drafted the outline for manuscript, DJ has commented on it.

### 09/11/2023 - 09/15/2023
- played with the [demo-protocal](https://github.com/yibeichan/demo-protocol), got some errors for loading the webpage

### 09/05/2023 - 09/08/2023
- DJ and YC went through YC's PR and then merged it
- YC will use the newly added assessment to create a protocol (via reproschema-ui repo). This would be useful for
  - testing whether the assessments works
  - checking whether the reproschema-ui documentation needs any improvement
  - writing the paper because making this protocal can help us to put our feet into user's shoes to see what kind of obstacels they would ecounter, etc.

### 08/28/2023 - 09/01/2023
- Revised the 12 assessments in this [PR](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/pull/67) 

### 08/24/2023
- Start (manually) collecting free HBN assessments, shared on [SIG Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19WaMiDkIfXoBbIP4DfMj57j0Q9IHq2E-?usp=drive_link). Kseniia has access too.
- We can't calculate subscores for CBCL, because it's not free. We can't make it public either. This applies to all private/paid assessments. (Kseniia)
- Dorota and I will review this [PR](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/pull/67) on 08/29/2023.

### 07/2023
