## Project Updates

@08/17/2023
> First meeting with Fabio, agreed on the goal of this project: Explore the heterogeneity/idiosyncrasy within the ASD group. Specifically:
> - we will do ASD vs TD comparison as the baseline checking
> - our focus will be within ASD group

@08/23/2023â€”08/24/2023
> - Cleaned the eye-tracking data with behavioral information, figured out who has watched which movie(s) in what order.
> - Met with Fabio for next steps:
> - - YC will extract time series data from eye-tracking txt. I need to **feel** the data to come up concrete/interesting RQs. 
> - - FC will explore the phenotype data and the stimuli. We may need to coordinate with MK and JM at some point.
