# About This Book

Yibei Chen(@yibeichan), _Postdoctoral Associate @MIT_

This journal is to track my science projects since my time (07/2023â€”) at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/). This is also part of my weekly report for the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/).

Research rojects listed here are my first-author or co-first-author projects only. I will create one page to summarize all my other non-primary projects, if any.

The [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) (**Repro**ducible **N**euro**im**aging Computation) section includes tools & packages for which I am part of the developer/mantainance team.

The links in this jounral are semi-public. If you are not part of the team, please do not be surprised for having no access.
