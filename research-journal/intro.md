# About This Book

This journal is to track my science projects since my time (07/2023â€”) at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/). This is also part of my weekly report for the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/).

The Research section lists my first-author or co-first-author projects only. I will create one page to summarize all my other non-primary projects, if any.

The [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) (**Repro**ducible **N**euro**im**aging Computation) section includes tools & packages for which I am part of the developer/mantainance team.

The links in this jounral are semi-public. If you are part of the team but have no access, please let me know. 

My literature reading & notes are on Substack: [something neuro](https://yibei.substack.com/). I publish on web only, not via email, once a week.

Yibei Chen, Postdoctoral Associate
