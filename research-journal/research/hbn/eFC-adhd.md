## Project Updates
This project is aiming at OHBM 2024 submission (deadline: 11/17/2023)

### 10/02/2023 - 10/06/2023
- YC and MK met, set up timelines:
    - by 10/13, YC will finish participants selection and MK will double check afterwards
    - by 10/20, YC will get eFC matrix for each participants
    - by 10/27, mixed-effect modeling should be done (if nothing wrong with the eFC matrice)
    - by 11/3, fix any potential errors
    - by 11/10, abstract should be done and sent to SG
- other notes (for abstract only):
    - using movie TP data
    - select participants for 3 groups (combined, inattentive, control), match age, sex if possible
    - if possible, address comorbidity in selection & mix-modeling (if we don't have time for OHBM, we will do it later for the paper)
