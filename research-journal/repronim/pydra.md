### 10/16/2023 - 10/20/2023
- this week is pydra hack week and we have meetings almost every day working on improving tutorials
- YC & DJ may still spend some time keep working on it next week (depends on how YC's SfN & OHBM analyses pan out)

### 09/18/2023 - 09/22/2023
- added [type-checking](https://github.com/nipype/pydra-tutorial/pull/47) to the tutorial, but then this new version of pydra has some conflicts with my old code on 2nd level GLM
- during pydra meeting, we discussed creating/updating/integrating documentation & tutorial. more details will come during the hackthon week (10/16-10/20).

### 08/24/2023
Met with Dorota, we will introduce the new [typing-checking](https://github.com/nipype/pydra/pull/662) to the tutorial.
