    "- YC need to update plots/figures\n",
    "- new concerns raised. \n",
    "- - we need behavioral ratings for each event (how to get it?)\n",
    "- - we need to do some network-level analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 09/11/2023 - 09/15/2023\n",
    "- disagreement resolved, move to plotting and manuscript writing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 09/05/2023 - 09/08/2023\n",
    "- SN and YC have disagreement on processing the behavioral event boundary data\n",
    "- ZZ and SN suggested different methods on detecting peaks\n",
    "- YC will run analysis again this Sunday\n",

    "- `--use-aroma` is depricated since fMRIPrep 23.1.0\n",
    "- We go for `cifti` format\n",
    "- Cofluctuation calculation ready for all parcel versions\n",
    "- TODOs:\n",
    "  - finish the behavioral event segmentation analysis\n",
    "  - keep writing the methods part while doing the analysis\n",

    "Met with SN; TODOs for the coming week:\n",
    "- new fmriprep + preproc data ready (from GE). But I need to check what `--use-aroma` did. SN is concerned about `--output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat `; we should be more cautious when modifying the original BOLD signals (minimize the resampling on BOLD as much as possible).\n",
    "- I need to figure out `cifti` format and rerun our previous analyses.\n",
    "- Prolific data collection completed! Within 3 hours! Now I need to figure out how to analyze it.\n",
    "- Thinking about how to create Figure 1 (schematic).\n",
    "- Keep revising the intro part.\n",
