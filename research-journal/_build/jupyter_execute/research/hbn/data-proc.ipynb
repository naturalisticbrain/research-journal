    "I am running fmriprep and xcp-d on release 10 subjects. Jeff is taking care of releases 1-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 700 subjects in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "For movie data:\n",
    "- 45 subjects do not have either `func` or `anat`, should be excluded.\n",
    "- 3 subjects miss `fmap` but not other parts, should be fmriprepped with `--ignore fieldmaps`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 08/28/2023 - 09/01/2023\n",
    "- Started the GitHub repo on SIG with Jeff to document code & record successful/failed subjects\n",
    "- Realized that I only ran fmriprep + xcp-d on movie data, now running the pipeline on the resting state data\n",
    "- Met with Jeff on Monday discussing plans after fmriprep + xcp-d, mostly we need to come up with quality control measures/assessments so that we can filter out unqualified data for further analysis. This is different from MRIQC because (1) we didn't run MRIQC before fMRIPrep, which we should ... and (2) our assessments are more naturalistic analysis focused; for people who want to run other type of analyses, they can come up with their own customized assessments.\n",

    "### 08/25/2023\n",
    "The second round of fmriprep + xcp-d finished with mixed sucess, two major errors found:\n",
    "- `mkdir: write error: Disk quota exceeded` \n",
    "- - -> cleaned my `tmp` folder and rerun those subjects.\n",
    "- `slurmstepd: error:.*DUE TO TIME LIMIT*`\n",
    "- - -> I'll fix this once I fix all other errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 08/21/2023\n",
    "After this first round (I call it first round because all subjects were submitted simultaneously, but this is almost my 5th or 6th times running the same script on them), two major errors found:\n",
    "- `ValueError: Only one phase-encoding direction <j-> found across sources.` 66 subjects missing the other PE direction `j` file. \n",
    "- - -> rerun fmriprep with `--ignore fieldmaps`. I tried `--use-syn-sdc`, which still gave me the same error\n",
    "- `slurmstepd: error:.*DUE TO TIME LIMIT*` those subjects (n=21) were stuck at `resume recon-all`\n",
    "- - -> I guess I will give them another chance. If the same, I'll just let them go\n",
    "- I do see some other minor errors during xcp-d, which don't make too much sense to me at this point, I will deal with them during the final round."
