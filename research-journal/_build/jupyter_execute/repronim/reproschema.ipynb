    "- hbcd-schema has some problems: \n",
    "  - my github folder was under icloud so it syncs in real time; the hbcd data dictionary is huge and generates a lot of files for every conversion; i was too fast for \"delete old version, copy new version, & git add .\" but then by the time i finished typing commit message, both versions appeared in the folder. I didn't realize what happen until later, which means that some tags may have two versions so I want to redo it to make sure things are correct.\n",
    "  - I notice that for some data dictionary versions, especially when there are 2 version within a month, I couldn't find the differences between two converted versions. By \"I couldn't find the differences\" I mean I deleted the old one and added the new one git can't notice the changes. I'm thinking my converting tool may have failed to capture certain part of the reproschema so two conversions got the same result. (if I'm making any sense here)\n",
    "  - monday i spent the whole day trying to fix the branch logic at the activity level, opened an [issue here](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui/issues/320). I'm thinking about adding a new part in `components` to take care of the between activity logic. haven't got time to implment it yet.\n",

    "- software side: working on improving the `redcap2reproschema` tool based on `hbcd` and `bridge2ai`\n",
    "  - `hbcd`: got the data dictionary using redcap API, but haven't figured out how to retrive historical versions yet\n",
    "  - `bridge2ai`: we start a thread with evan and alistir, will have more updates next week\n",
    "  - `nimh-minimal`: we have some javascript bugs in `ui` needs to be fixed, haven't been fixed yet\n",
