    "We suspect that the [midthickness problem](https://github.com/PennLINC/babs/issues/138) is probably due to that the long path generated by BABS failed to run properly in freesurfer.\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "  is one of those not-helpful ones. Dorota thinks it might be related to OpenMind (some nodes specific). Will be checking and tracking those nodes.\n",
    "- After many resubmits/failures, I got another error related to `midthickness` node in fmriprep, which I first thought was a freesurfer problem and posted on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/t/midthickness0-node-crash-during-fmriprep-23-1-4/26592/5). Later, it turned out that it might still be an BABS problem or an OpenMind problem. Tracked in this [issue](https://github.com/PennLINC/babs/issues/138)."
