## Project Updates

### 1. Converting HBN assessments

**Code on GitHub**: [Private](https://github.com/yibeichan/hbn_practice/tree/main/reproschema)

@07/2023
> - Start converting HBN assessments to reproschema library; Maedbh provided cleaned items
> - Maedbh introduced Kseniia
> - Dorota has been helping with programing.

@08/24/2023
> - Start (manually) collecting free HBN assessments, shared on [SIG Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19WaMiDkIfXoBbIP4DfMj57j0Q9IHq2E-?usp=drive_link). Kseniia has access too.
> - We can't calculate subscores for CBCL, because it's not free. We can't make it public either. This applies to all private/paid assessments. (Kseniia)
> - Dorota and I will review this [PR](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/pull/67) on 08/29/2023.
