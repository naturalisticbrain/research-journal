# Eye-Tracking ASD

## Project Description
Explore the heterogeneity/idiosyncrasy within the ASD group through eye-tracking and phenotype data.

| **Collaborators**| Fabio Catania, TBD |
| **MIT Project**  | Yes |

## Project Updates

### 08/28/2023 - 09/01/2023
- Revised my behavioral data cleaning code from last week
- Reformatted the eyetracking txt into multiple CSV files (e.g., fixation, saccade, blink, etc.).
- Figured out the actual starting & ending time for the eyetracking data! Haven't extracted it yet but will do it next week! Then we can start playing with the data...

### 08/23/2023 â€” 08/24/2023
- Cleaned the eye-tracking data with behavioral information, figured out who has watched which movie(s) in what order.
- Met with Fabio for next steps:
  - YC will extract time series data from eye-tracking txt. I need to **feel** the data to come up concrete/interesting RQs. 
  - FC will explore the phenotype data and the stimuli. We may need to coordinate with MK and JM at some point.

### 08/17/2023
First meeting with Fabio, agreed on the goal of this project: Explore the heterogeneity/idiosyncrasy within the ASD group. Specifically:
- we will do ASD vs TD comparison as the baseline checking
- our focus will be within ASD group
