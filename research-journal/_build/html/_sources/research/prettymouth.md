@08/24/2023
> Met with SN; TODOs for the coming week:
> - new fmriprep + preproc data ready (from GE). But I need to check what `--use-aroma` did. SN is concerned about `--output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat `; we should be more cautious when modifying the original BOLD signals (minimize the resampling on BOLD as much as possible).
> - I need to figure out `cifti` format and rerun our previous analyses.
> - Prolific data collection completed! Within 3 hours! Now I need to figure out how to analyze it.
> - Thinking about how to create Figure 1 (schematic).
> - Keep revising the intro part.
